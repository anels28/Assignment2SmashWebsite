		<p class="intro">As a fifth-year student at the University of Rochester,
		I am double majoring in Business Finance and Art History, with a minor in Computer Science.
		Due to computer science and coding’s popularity and its extensive use in all kinds of fields
		and the business world, I have decided to re-classify from Class of 2019 to Class of 2020
		in order to complete this challenging but extremely useful minor and coding abilities.
		Until now, I have acquired coding experience including Python, R Studio, HTML, CSS and little
		knowledge of JavaScript Plugins and I am thrilled to learn more from both my professors and classmates.</p>
